# Arithmetic

Write a program that takes two integers, a and b, as input.
Your program should compute and display:
- The sum of a and b
- The difference when b is subtracted from a
- The product of a and b
- The quotient when a is divided by b
- The remainder when a is divided by b
- The result of log10 a
- The result of a^b

<strong>The output from your program, when called with the code in the Test column, should be exactly as shown in the Result column<strong>
