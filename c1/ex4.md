# Sum of the First n Positive Integers

Write a program that takes a positive integer, n, as input and then displays the sum of all of the integers from 1 to n. The sum of the first n positive integers can be computed using the formula:
````m
sum = n * (n + 1)/2
````

<strong>The output from your program, when called with the code in the Test column, should be exactly as shown in the Result column:<strong>
<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse; text-align: left; width: 100%;">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Sy√∂te</th>
      <th>Tulos</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>10</td>
      <td>The sum of the first 10 positive integers is 55</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>The sum of the first 4 positive integers is 10</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
